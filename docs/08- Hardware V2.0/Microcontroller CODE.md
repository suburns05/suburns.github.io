## Overview

If I could do this all over again, I don't think I would want to have changed much based on the requirements nessisary. However if given more time I would love to see the motor actually pivot the sensors and actually utalize the "limit switches". This would require a more robust power system with an aditinoal mosphet and a signifcantly larger motor. I would also liked to have picked a brighter LED that would actually serve as a light sourse rather then doubleing as the Debug LED.
