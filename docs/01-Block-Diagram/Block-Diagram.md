## Overview
My section is the Input/Output board, the bridge between our sensors and lights. 

Since my unit is the hub of our other units it has 2 team connetions.The motor functions as my actuator, it will "scan" the room for sound and the code to triger a light if it gets confirmation from both the sound and the night light board. The first two buttons are limits to the motors range of movement. For the sake of time and demonstration of the features of the board, the motor will not hold up the other boards and it will not hit the "limit switches". 

Button 1: Start

Button 2: End

Button 3: reset

The motor will pivot the sensors to cover a wider range
