**Choice:** Option 1: UA7905CKCS

**Rationale:** It is the option I am most familiar with and I wouldn't have to wait for it to arrive. I have a lot of reasorces on how to build my own power supply with this exact part so it benefits me the most. While something more compact would be nice I think for ease of life and design this part will be just fine.
